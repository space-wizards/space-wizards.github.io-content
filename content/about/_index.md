# What is Space Station 14?

**Space Station 14** (SS14 for short) is a community driven project to get the open source game [Space Station 13](https://spacestation13.com/) into a new engine and free from its current engine, [BYOND](https://secure.byond.com/). BYOND is an incredibly dated engine, and is not cutting it. It's a pain to develop for, slow, proprietary, and looks like it's from 2005. <!-- TODO: Verify how accurate this number is. --> Along with this we will try to make the game more enjoyable all around, such as pixel movement and a consistent style.

Originally, the SS14 project was a continuation of [Goonstation](https://forum.ss13.co/)'s remake attempt, which was abandoned and [open sourced on 19 of January, 2015](https://archive.fo/xey2L).

Space Station 14 has been built from the ground to be fast, modular, cross-platform, as well as fully moddable and extendable. Anyone can add basic items or variations to the game via the easily accessible YAML prototype system, and with some knowledge of C#, add or modify even core functionalities and systems.

## Status

Currently, the project is in a "pre-alpha" state. We have many tasks ahead of us. On this website you will be able to find progress reports as long as we're kicking.

## Getting involved

Rome was not built in a day, and neither was SS14. We can always use extra hands! The entire project is open source and available on GitHub here:

* Main Repo: [space-wizards/space-station-14](https://github.com/space-wizards/space-station-14).
* Engine: [space-wizards/RobustToolbox](https://github.com/space-wizards/RobustToolbox).

We primarily communicate through Discord, although there is an IRC channel that's connected to Discord with a bot.

* [Discord Invite](https://discord.gg/T5EejNS)
